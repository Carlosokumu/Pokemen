    * [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx) - Major improvement to the original Android [Support Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index), which is no longer maintained.
    * [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - Jetpack Compose is Android‚Äôs modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. Quickly bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.
    * [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - A concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
    * [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html)
